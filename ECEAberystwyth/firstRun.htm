                <li>Abstract: Motivated by the potential 
high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials, the 
high-pressure structures of SiH 4 (H 2 ) 2 in the pressure range 50–300 
GPa were extensively explored by using a genetic algorithm. An 
intriguing layered orthorhombic (Ccca) structure was revealed to be 
energetically stable above 248 GPa with the inclusion of zero-point 
energy. The Ccca structure is metallic and composed of hydrogen shared 
SiH 8 dodecahedra layers intercalated by orientationally ordered 
molecular H 2 . Application of the Allen-Dynes modified McMillan 
equation yields remarkably high superconducting temperatures of 98–107 K
 at 250 GPa, among the highest values reported so far for phononmediated
 superconductors. Analysis reveals a unique superconducting mechanism 
that the direct interactions between H 2 and SiH 4 molecules at high 
pressure play the major role in the high superconductivity, while the 
contribution from H 2 vibrons is minor.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Ni and Se x-ray absorption spectroscopic 
studies of the [NiFeSe]hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio baculatus are 
described. The Ni site geometry is pseudo-octahedral with a coordinating
 ligand composition of 3-4 (N,O) at 2.06 angstrom, 1-2 (S,Cl) at 2.17 
angstrom, and 1 Se at 2.44 angstrom. The Se coordination environment 
consists of 1 C at 2.0 angstrom and a heavy scatterer M (M = Ni or Fe) 
at ≈ 2.4 angstrom. These results are interpreted in terms of a 
selenocysteine residue coordinated to the Ni site. The possible role of 
the Ni-Se site in the catalytic activation of H<sub>2</sub> is discussed.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Diatomic hydride and deuteride spectra of 
all the second row transition metals have been studied in absorption 
between 290 and 700 nm behind reflected shock waves. The first known 
spectra of ScH, ScD, VH, and VD have been identified, together with new 
spectra due to CoH, CoD, NiH, and NiD. Some new bands of CoD and NiD are
 analysed, and it is shown that an electronic isotope shift exists in 
NiD. The effect of such a shift on the determination of vibrational 
constants is discussed.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Production and usage of di-hydrogen, H₂, 
in micro-organisms is catalysed by highly active, 'ancient' 
metalloenzymes known as hydrogenases. Based on the number and identity 
of metal atoms in their active sites, hydrogenases fall into three main 
classes, [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-. All contain the unusual ligand CO 
(and in most cases CN⁻ as well) making them intriguing examples of 
'organometallic' cofactors. These ligands render the active sites 
superbly 'visible' using infrared spectroscopy, which complements the 
use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in studying 
mechanisms and identifying intermediates. Hydrogenases are becoming a 
focus of attention for research into future energy technologies, not 
only H₂ production but also H₂ oxidation in fuel cells. Hydrogenases 
immobilized on electrodes exhibit high electrocatalytic activity, 
providing not only an important new technique for their investigation, 
but also a basis for novel fuel cells either using the enzyme itself, or
 inspired synthetic catalysts. Favourable comparisons have been made 
with platinum electrocatalysts, an advantage of enzymes being their 
specificity for H₂ and tolerance of CO. A challenge for exploiting 
hydrogenases is their sensitivity to O₂, but some organisms are known to
 produce enzymes that overcome this problem by subtle alterations of the
 active site and gas access channels.</li>
