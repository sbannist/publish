                <li>Abstract: Earlier work has shown now certain 
field-theoretic scattering amplitudes can be represented in a manifestly
 finite manner by twistor diagrams. The theory of twistor diagrams is 
here further developed and applied to the example of massless Compton 
scattering. Our results justify the elegant diagrammatic formula 
originally written down by Penrose for this example.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The problem of the softening of radiation 
by multiple Compton scattering in an atmosphere of free electrons is 
considered. An idealized problem in plane-parallel atmospheres is 
formulated and the appropriate equation of transfer is approximately 
solved. The modified distributions with wave-length of the radiation 
emergent after transmission through various optical thicknesses of an 
incident monochromatic flux of radiation are tabulated. The calculations
 show that there is a relatively high probability for quite large shifts
 after transmission through optical thicknesses of order even unity.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A new design for a γ-ray Compton 
scattering spectrometer is presented. The spectrometer uses an annular 
geometry that is the inversion of the annular geometry used in earlier 
experiments with americium γ-rays. A small source is placed directly in 
front of the detector so that it is the detector and not the source that
 provides the annulus. Measurements of the Compton profile of aluminium 
are used to evaluate the new design. For small samples it is possible to
 increase the intensity by a factor of up to 104 while maintaining the 
resolution. This should make it possible to obtain accurate data for 
many compounds that could not previously be studied because of the 
difficulties associated with obtaining large single crystals.</li>

recently been developed as a tool for the determination of Compton 
profiles. In this paper we examine the technique in detail to determine 
the optimum conditions for doing these experiments. We seek to quantify 
the effects of multiple scattering and radiation damage, which are the 
crucial limiting factors in this work, and place limits on the accuracy 
and resolution that can be obtained. The energy-dependent corrections to
 the data are considered and a number of possible improvements to the 
experimental method are suggested.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The high-temperature superconducting 
cuprate La 2−x Sr x CuO₄ (LSCO) shows several phases ranging from 
antiferromagnetic insulator to metal with increasing hole doping. To 
understand how the nature of the hole state evolves with doping, we have
 carried out high-resolution Compton scattering measurements at room 
temperature together with first-principles electronic structure 
computations on a series of LSCO single crystals in which the hole 
doping level varies from the underdoped (UD) to the overdoped (OD) 
regime. Holes in the UD system are found to primarily populate the O 2p x
 /p y orbitals. In contrast, the character of holes in the OD system is 
very different in that these holes mostly enter Cu d orbitals. 
High-resolution Compton scattering provides a bulk-sensitive method for 
imaging the orbital character of dopants in complex materials.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A new experimental technique has recently 
been developed for characterizing small dislocation loops in the 
electron microscope by collecting elastic diffuse scattering patterns in
 the vicinity of Bragg reflections. In this paper we develop the theory 
and computational approaches for simulating such patterns. We apply the 
anisotropic elastic theory of displacement fields of planar dislocation 
loops of arbitrary shape to compute the distortion diffuse scattering 
amplitudes. To do this we extend methods based on kinematical scattering
 theory, previously used to simulate X-ray and neutron diffuse 
scattering patterns. We demonstrate significant differences in the 
diffuse scattering patterns for the electron scattering case that arise 
from the small width of the incident electron beam, and under weak-beam 
conditions. We show that the method may be used to distinguish between 
individual, very small, vacancy or interstitial loops. We also show that
 elastic anisotropy may have an influence on elastic diffuse scattering 
patterns from loops, to an extent that varies with the magnitude of the 
deviation parameter.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A thermal radiative component is likely to
 accompany the first stages of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts 
(GRBs) and X-ray flashes. We analyse the effect of such a component on 
the observable spectrum, assuming that the observable effects are due to
 a dissipation process occurring below or near the thermal photosphere. 
For comparable energy densities in the thermal and leptonic components, 
the dominant emission mechanism is Compton scattering. This leads to a 
nearly flat energy spectrum ($\nu F_{\nu}\propto \nu ^{0}$) above the 
thermal peak at approximately 10-100 keV and below 10-100 MeV, for a 
wide range of optical depths 0.03 ≲ τ ≲ 100, regardless of the details 
of the dissipation mechanism or the strength of the magnetic field. For 
higher values of the optical depth, a Wien peak is formed at 100 keV to 1
 MeV. In particular, these results are applicable to the internal shock 
model of GRBs, as well as to slow dissipation models, e.g. as might be 
expected from reconnection, if the dissipation occurs at a 
sub-photospheric radii. We conclude that dissipation near the thermal 
photosphere can naturally explain (i) clustering of the peak energy at 
sub-MeV energies at early times, (ii) steep slopes observed at low 
energies, and (iii) a flat spectrum above 10 keV at late times. Our 
model thus provides an alternative scenario to the optically thin 
synchrotron-synchrotron self-Compton model.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Because of their inherently high flux 
allowing the detection of clear signals, black hole x-ray binaries are 
interesting candidates for polarization studies, even if no polarization
 signals have been observed from them before. Such measurements would 
provide further detailed insight into these sources' emission 
mechanisms. We measured the polarization of the gamma-ray emission from 
the black hole binary system Cygnus X-1 with the International Gamma-Ray
 Astrophysics Laboratory Imager on Board the Integral Satellite 
(INTEGRAL/IBIS) telescope. Spectral modeling of the data reveals two 
emission mechanisms: The 250- to 400-keV (kilo-electron volt) data are 
consistent with emission dominated by Compton scattering on thermal 
electrons and are weakly polarized. The second spectral component seen 
in the 400-keV to 2-MeV band is by contrast strongly polarized, 
revealing that the MeV emission is probably related to the jet first 
detected in the radio band.</li>

                <li>Abstract: In electron scattering measurements of the
 Compton profiles of solids, multiple scattering events contribute 
strongly to the observed profile. The dominant contribution to the 
multiple scattering arises from events in which Bragg scattering is 
followed by Compton scattering. The Bragg scattering is calculated by 
using a multi-slice approach that allows for dynamical scattering, and 
each Bragg beam is then treated as a source of Compton scattering. In 
this paper, the dependence of multiple scattering on the energy of the 
incident beam and on the thickness, orientation, crystal structure and 
atomic number of the sample are investigated to determine the parameters
 that affect the multiple scattering most strongly, and to seek ways in 
which multiple scattering can be reduced in experimental work.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Photoelectron microscopy developed as part
 of the general advance in electron optics and conventional electron 
microscopy. The recent emphasis on energy analysis through photoelectron
 spectroscopy has led to several related developments in which the 
possibility of obtaining photoelectron spectra from very small object 
areas has emerged. Either chemical analysis, and especially molecular 
chemical analysis, becomes possible from areas less than a square 
micrometre, or magnified images may be obtained by using closely 
selected electron energies. Both of these possibilities are realized in 
the Oxford photoelectron spectromicroscope, which is described. Other 
means of producing electron images include the use of metastable or fast
 atoms. The use of a magnetic field, which is an essential part of the 
Oxford instrument, introduces the opportunity for a number of novel

                <li>Abstract: A general phenomenological framework is 
provided for the discussion of the inelastic scattering of polarized 
electrons (muons) on polarized nucleons, when regarded as the absorption
 of polarized virtual photons. The relevant cross sections compare 
parallel and antiparallel orientations of the photon helicity and 
nucleon spin, and also deal with linear combinations of longitudinal and
 transverse polarization. The polarization asymmetry for transverse 
polarization, P, assumes a scaling form in the deep inelastic scattering
 region, and should go to zero as ω -1 for large ω . The latter behavior
 is connected, through the use of the improved scaling variable ω s, 
with the high energy real photon situation. A sum rule is exhibited 
which implies that P must change sign in the deep inelastic region. This
 sum rule also yields the known Drell-Hearn sum rule for real photon 
Compton scattering, when combined with another, new, sum rule for the 
anomalous magnetic moment. The latter is verified in the context of pure
 electrodynamics to the lowest order in α . Finally, it is conjectured 
that P specifically changes from negative to positive values as ω varies
 from 1 to ∞ .</li>

                <li>Abstract: The excess extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) 
emission detected in the Virgo and Coma clusters is explained by inverse
 Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons, which are 
scattered by the relativistic electrons that account for the extended 
radio synchrotron emission of these clusters. The lower limits of the 
average magnetic fields of these clusters estimated from the EUV excess 
are close to the equipartition magnetic fields derived from radio 
observations, indicating that the electron energies and magnetic field 
energies might be close to equipartition. The excess emission suggests 
energy reservoirs of ∼10$^{61}$ and ∼10$^{60}$ ergs for the Coma and 
Virgo clusters, respectively.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Both the thickness and the composition of a
 specimen can be deduced from plasmon spectroscopy, which is readily 
recorded with an electron microscope to which has been attached an 
electron spectrometer of resolution 1-3 eV. This is illustrated in the 
study of alkali metals and sp metals such as magnesium and aluminium, 
which are produced by decomposing ternary or binary hydrides (for 
example, NaAlH4 or MgH2). But other materials, including silicon, are 
also amenable to studies of this kind. The elemental composition, 
electronic structure and inter-atomic distances of a sample can be 
derived from the core-electron (K, L, M edge) loss peaks and their fine 
structure. And from the near-edge energy loss structure, and in 
particular from the 'white line' intensity ratios (for example, L2/L3), 
the number of d-electrons and hence the oxidation state of transition 
elements in compounds of first-row transition-metal series may be 
determined. In the region beyong the near-edge structure, extended 
electron energy loss fine structure (e.x.e.l.f.s.) is observed and this 
may be used to obtain information about the local co-ordination of 
different atoms in the sample. Finally, by monitoring the Doppler 
broadening of the scattered electrons liberated from the sample as a 
consequence of the 'electron' equivalent of the Compton process, we can 
probe the electronic properties of the solid in momentum space. This 
reveals the nature of the bonding in simple solids; and, in particular, 
reveals whether an amorphous sample of carbon is more nearly graphitic 
or adamantine.</li>

                <li>Abstract: ABSTRACT. We present an empirical model of
 Comptonization for fitting the spectra of X-ray binaries. This model, 
named simpl, has been developed as a package implemented in XSPEC. With 
only two free parameters, simpl is competitive as the simplest model of 
Compton scattering. Unlike the pervasive standard power-law model, simpl
 incorporates the basic features of Compton scattering of soft photons 
by energetic coronal electrons. Using a simulated spectrum, we 
demonstrate that simpl closely matches the behavior of physical 
Comptonization models that consider the effects of optical depth, 
coronal electron temperature, and geometry. We present fits to RXTE 
spectra of the black hole transient H1743–322 and a BeppoSAX spectrum of
 LMC X–3 using both simpl and the standard power-law model. A comparison
 of the results shows that simpl gives equally good fits, while 
eliminating the troublesome divergence of the standard power-law model 
at low energies. simpl is completely flexible and can be used 
self-consistently with any seed spectrum of photons. We show an example 
of how simpl—unlike the standard power law—teamed up with diskbb (the 
standard model of disk accretion) provides a uniform disk normalization 
that is unaffected by moderate Comptonization.</li>

scattering on single nucleons, viewed as virtual photon absorption, are 
reexamined with the nonspeculative, phenomenological attitude of source 
theory. The use of a double spectral representation for forward 
scattering, and of experimental inputs from the low energy resonance 
region and the high energy real photon diffraction region, lead 
naturally to the general observed characteristics of deep inelastic 
scattering. A reasonably successful description of deviations from 
simple scaling behavior is also presented.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The effects of γ rays and electron beams 
on the germination, outgrowth and the synthesis of protein and RNA of 
Bacillus pumilus spores were investigated to clarify the difference in 
the effects of the two types of radiations on bacterial spores. Gamma 
irradiation facilitated the germination to a slightly larger degree than
 electron irradiation. The outgrowth, growth and the synthesis of 
protein and RNA were inhibited by γ irradiation to a greater extent than
 electron irradiation, when the spores were irradiated at the same dose.
 However, the effects of the two types of radiations were the same when 
the spores were irradiated with electron beams at a dose 30% higher than
 γ rays. The results indicate that the effects of electron beams on 
bacterial spores and those of γ rays are qualitatively the same but 
quantitatively different.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Historians and sociologists have 
highlighted the importance of skills, local practices and material 
culture in their studies of experimental sciences. This paper argues 
that the acquisition and transfer of skills in theoretical sciences 
should be understood in similar terms. Using the example of Feynman 
diagrams - first introduced by the US theoretical physicist Richard 
Feynman in 1948 as an aid for making certain kinds of calculations - we 
study how physicists in the USA, Japan, and the Soviet Union learned how
 to use the new tools and put them to work. Something about the 
diagrammatic tools could be learned from written instructions alone, at a
 distance from those physicists already 'in the know', although this 
type of transfer proved to be very difficult, slow, and rare. The rate 
at which new physicists began to use the diagrams in various settings, 
and the types of uses to which the diagrams were put, reveal the 
interplay between geopolitics, personal communication, and pedagogical 
infrastructures in shaping how paper tools spread.</li>

for this process contains an extra factor e2/ $\hslash $ c compared with
 ordinary Compton scattering. There is great preference for one soft and
 one hard photon to be emitted, rather than two photons of approximately
 equal energy. The hard photon is most likely to be ejected into a 
narrow cone in the forward direction and, as the bombarding energy 
increases, this cone becomes narrower. All these results were to be 
expected. However, the soft photon also has a considerable preference 
for small-angle scattering, and its angular distribution is not roughly 
isotropic as one might have expected.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Using a pulsed electron beam, we 
investigated the dependence of micronucleus formation on the incident 
electron energy in AG01522 human diploid fibroblasts after nontargeted 
irradiations at 25 and 80 keV. Examining the dose response, we found 
that 25 keV electrons are more effective than 80 keV electrons at 
producing biological damage for a given dose. Our results demonstrating 
the induction of micronuclei as a function of incident electron energy 
offer direct support for the hypothesis that the electron track end is 
responsible for the biological damage occurring in the cell.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The absolute structure factors of silicon 
measured in Part I are examined in detail using Dawson's structure 
factor formalism with recent theoretical estimates of free atom 
Hartree-Fock wavefunctions (Clementi 1965). It is not possible to 
describe the structure of silicon with only Kubic Harmonic expansions 
having physically reasonable coefficients. If the valence-shell form 
factor is radially compressed by 6.8% then we can obtain an excellent 
fit using only the third- and fourth-order Kubic Harmonics with 
amplitudes F3=+1.012 and G4=-0.206. There is some evidence that the 
anomalous dispersion corrections for silicon which are available in the 
literature are in error by 0.02 electron units. From the high-order 
reflexions we have measured the X-ray Debye temperatures of silicon as Θ
 M = 536.3 ± 5.0 K at 92.2 K and Θ M = 532.5 ± 2.0 K at 293.2 K. The 
increase in Θ M at low temperature is smaller than had been expected 
theoretically. Our measurements of the 555 structure factor permit us to
 confirm Nunes's (1971) upper-bound estimate of the anharmonic force 
constant for silicon. Finally, we have compared our results with the 
self-consistent orthogonalized-plane-wave band structure calculations of
 Stukel &amp; Euwema (1970) for silicon atoms in a crystal. We find that
 the Kohn-Sham-Gaspar model of exchange results in structure factors 
which are in much better agreement with those measured than are 
structure factors calculated using Slater's exchange term. As in the 
interpretation based on Dawson's formalism there is evidence here that 
the theoretical anomalous dispersion corrections may be inadequate.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Depending on different positions in the 
debate on scientific realism, there are various accounts of the 
phenomena of physics. For scientific realists like Bogen and Woodward, 
phenomena are matters of fact in nature, i.e., the effects explained and
 predicted by physical theories. For empiricists like van Fraassen, the 
phenomena of physics are the appearances observed or perceived by 
sensory experience. Constructivists, however, regard the phenomena of 
physics as artificial structures generated by experimental and 
mathematical methods. My paper investigates the historical background of
 these different meanings of "phenomenon" in the traditions of physics 
and philosophy. In particular, I discuss Newton's account of the 
phenomena and Bohr's view of quantum phenomena, their relation to the 
philosophical discussion, and to data and evidence in current particle 
physics and quantum optics.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear explosions on a 
white dwarf surface fueled by mass accreted from a companion star. 
Current physical models posit that shocked expanding gas from the nova 
shell can produce x-ray emission, but emission at higher energies has 
not been widely expected. Here, we report the Fermi Large Area Telescope
 detection of variable γ-ray emission (0.1 to 10 billion electron volts)
 from the recently detected optical nova of the symbiotic star V407 
Cygni. We propose that the material of the nova shell interacts with the
 dense ambient medium of the red giant primary and that particles can be
 accelerated effectively to produce π° decay γ-rays from proton-proton 
interactions. Emission involving inverse Compton scattering of the red 
giant radiation is also considered and is not ruled out.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Methods are presented for deriving 
approximations containing small integer coefficients. This approach is 
useful for electronic hand calculators and programmable calculators, 
where it is important to minimize the number of keystrokes necessary to 
evaluate the function. For example, the probability $P(x)$ of exceeding 
$x$ standard deviations of either sign (Gaussian probability integral) 
is approximated by $$P(x) \approx \operatorname{EXP} \big\lbrack 
-\frac{(83x + 351)x + 562}{703/x + 165} \bigrbrack$$ with a relative 
error less than 0.042% over the range $0 &lt; x &lt; 5.5 (1 &gt; P(x) 
&gt; 4 \times 10^{-8})$. Other examples presented are the functional 
inverse of P(x)$; the Klein-Nishina cross section for Compton 
scattering; photoelectric cross sections in $H_2 O,\operatorname{Bone, 
Fe, NaI}$, and $\operatorname{Pb}$; and the pair production cross 
section in $\operatorname{Pb}$</li>

tera--electron volt (TeV) ( $10^{12}$ eV) γ-ray flux, on time scales of 
days, from the nearby radio galaxy M87 is reported. These variations are
 about 10 times as fast as those observed in any other wave band and 
imply a very compact emission region with a dimension similar to the 
Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. We thus can exclude 
several other sites and processes of the γ-ray production. The 
observations confirm that TeV γ rays are emitted by extragalactic 
sources other than blazars, where jets are not relativistically beamed 
toward the observer.</li>

                <li>Abstract: This paper represents a first step toward a
 moment method for dose calculations in radiotherapy. Starting from a 
deterministic transport model for electron radiation and its 
Fokker-Planck approximation, a new macroscopic model is presented. We 
investigate several ways to simplify the deterministic model having two 
goals in mind, lower computation times on the one hand and high accuracy
 and model inherent incorporation of tissue inhomogeneities on the other
 hand. While being fast, the second property is lost in the often used 
pencil-beam models. We discuss the properties of well-known macroscopic 
models and design a new model, which combines their advantages. Several 
test cases, including the irradiation of a water phantom, are presented.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Over the past few years, very-high-energy 
gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a truly observational discipline, 
with many detected sources representing different galactic and 
extragalactic source populations--supernova remnants, pulsar wind 
nebulae, giant molecular clouds, star formation regions, compact binary 
systems, and active galactic nuclei. It is expected that observations 
with the next generation of stereoscopic arrays of imaging atmospheric 
Cherenkov telescopes over a very broad energy range from $10^{10}$ to

                <li>Abstract: Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons)
 accelerated to relativistic speeds. Despite wide agreement that 
supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources of galactic cosmic rays, 
unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons in these objects is
 still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter interstellar 
material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into gamma 
rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of 
protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult 
because high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung
 and inverse Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic 
pion-decay feature in the gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44,
 with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provides direct 
evidence that cosmic-ray protons are accelerated in SNRs.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Differential cross-sections have been 
measured for the scattering of photons of mean energy 87 MeV by uranium 
at eight angles in the range from 1·18 to 4·48 mrad and by aluminium, 
silver, tungsten, lead and uranium at angles of 1·89 and 4·24 mrad, 
using a narrowly collimated bremsstrahlung beam from the Oxford 110 MeV 
synchrotron as the primary source of photons. A biased total-absorption 
Čerenkov counter was used to detect photons with energies near the peak 
energy of the bremsstrahlung spectrum, and absolute differential 
cross-sections were measured by comparing counting rates for photons in 
the primary and scattered beams. The experimental results, with the 
differential Compton scattering cross-sections of Klein and Nishina 
subtracted, were analyzed in terms of their variation with angle and 
atomic number, and can be described as consisting of a sharply peaked 
angular distribution with absolute cross-sections varying from element 
to element as Z4, together with a uniform distribution varying nearly as
 Z2; these distributions were identified with Delbruck scattering and 
with bremsstrahlung from secondary electrons in the scattering target, 
respectively. The Delbruck scattering cross-section thus determined is 
slightly more sharply peaked than the cross-section predicted by an 
approximate theory of Bethe &amp; Rohrlich.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Accurate knowledge of energy absorption 
coefficients is needed to calculate the absorbed dose in any material. 
The photon kerma for LiF relative to air and soft tissue is computed 
using energy absorption coefficient values for Li, F, air, and tissue. 
Values of energy absorption coefficients for air are already available 
in J. H. Hubbell's (Photon Cross-Sections, Attenuation Coefficients and 
Energy Absorption Coefficients from 10 KeV to 100 GeV. National Standard
 Reference Data System-National Bureau of Standards Report No. 29, 
Washington, D. C., 1969) tables. Those for tissue are obtained by adding
 the weighted average of the energy absorption coefficients of the 
different elements constituting the tissue. For fluorine, they are 
computed from the values given by F. H. Attix and W. C. Roesch (Eds, 
Radiation Dosimetry, Vol. I, Fundamentals. Academic Press, New 
York/London, 1968) for CaF<sub>2</sub> and Ca. The values for lithium 
have been computed taking into consideration the photoelectric effect, 
Compton process, and pair production. Corrections for radiative energy 
losses, fluorescence yields, screening of electrons, etc., are 
appropriately applied. The energy absorption coefficients due to 
photoeffect, Compton scattering, and pair production are added to get 
the total. The energy absorption cross-section data for photon energies 
from 0.01 to 10 MeV are tabulated for each interaction.</li>

                <li>Abstract: As the simplest problem involving the 
multiple scattering of gamma-rays, the case of perpendicular incidence 
on a plane slab has been studied by various simple theoretical methods. 
No exact solution is available as a test of these methods, but 
approximations of increasing accuracy, known to give too small a dose 
under the slab, have been combined with a theoretical upper limit for 
the dose, forming a zone in which the exact solution must lie. Most of 
the methods tested could be used even if pair-creation or the 
photoelectric effect gave an appreciable absorption, though for 
simplicity the computations have been carried out for pure Compton 
scattering and for quantum energies of a few MeV. Polarization by the 
Compton effect has been neglected. The best of the simple methods is a 
modification of the upper limit solution; in problems where this is too 
difficult to formulate, a good alternative is to calculate the dose from
 unscattered and once-scattered quanta, giving the latter the 
penetrating power of the incident quanta and the maximum possible 
energy-absorption cross-section.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Two different sets of Monte Carlo 
computations were carried out for the study of dose penetration of 
monoenergetic, low-energy (10 to 100 keV) photon beams incident on slabs
 of tissue. One program took into account coherent scattering and 
considered electron binding when finding the angle of scattering during 
incoherent scattering; the other simpler program, customarily used at 
higher energies, largely ignored these effects. For calculations at the 
source photon energy of 100 keV, it was found that there was negligible 
difference in dose distribution in the slab between the more and less 
complex type of calculations. The same thing was found to be true for 
the 30 and 10-keV source photon energies only for shallow penetration 
distances; and at deeper penetrations the simple approach tended to 
overestimate the dose appreciably. It is concluded that for penetration 
of low-energy photon beams into tissue, accurate calculational results 
cannot be assured with the neglect of coherent scattering effects and 
electron binding considerations in determining the scattering angles 
except for shallow depths of penetration.</li>

                <li>Abstract: In the present paper electron fluence 
spectra and backscatter dose factors for monoenergetic photons (50, 100,
 250 and 1250 keV) are presented. The influence of the atomic number of 
the backscatter materials glass, bone, steel and titanium is studied. 
For all radiations increases in dose were found in the immediate 
vicinity of the interface in a region extending over a distance 
determined by the photon energy. In a thin layer extending several tens 
of micrometers from the interface, a large increase in dose was found 
for 50 and 100 keV photons. The largest backscatter dose factor (3.5) 
was found for 50 keV photons and a steel interface. This large effect 
was found to be due largely to backscattered photoelectrons. K-shell 
fluorescent photons from titanium and steel were also included but were 
found to have almost no effect on backscatter dose factors or electron 
spectra. With both K-shell fluorescence and sampling of the 
photoelectron angular distribution switched off, much smaller 
backscatter factors were obtained. Beyond the thin region near the 
interface where the dose is increased, significant dose depressions were
 found for photons of these energies in a region extending several 
centimeters from the interface. The effect was maximum for 50 keV 
photons, for which dose depressions of about 35% for steel and titanium 
and 15% for glass and bone were obtained. For 250 and 1250 keV photons a
 more modest dose enhancement was found close to the interface (40-50%) 
but extending over a larger region (e.g. 5 mm for 1250 keV photons). 
Small differences in radiation quality nearer to the interface were 
found as expressed by track-averaged and dose-averaged restricted linear
 energy transfer, <tex-math>$\overline{{\rm LET}}_{100,{\rm T}}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$\overline{{\rm LET}}_{100,{\rm D}}$</tex-math>, with a maximum effect for the 100 keV photons. For this radiation quality a decrease of 50% in <tex-math>$\overline{{\rm LET}}_{100,{\rm T}}$</tex-math> was found close to the interface.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Recent observations of supernova remnants 
(SNRs) hint that they accelerate cosmic rays to energies close to ~ 10¹⁵
 electron volts. However, the nature of the particles that produce the 
emission remains ambiguous. We report observations of SNR W44 with the 
Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies between 2 × 10ɸ electron volts 
and 3 × 10¹¹ electron volts. The detection of a source with a morphology
 corresponding to the SNR shell implies that the emission is produced by
 particles accelerated there. The gamma-ray spectrum is well modeled 
with emission from protons and nuclei. Its steepening above ~ 10⁹ 
electron volts provides a probe with which to study how particle 
acceleration responds to environmental effects such as shock propagation
 in dense clouds and how accelerated particles are released into 
interstellar space.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Structure determination by diffraction 
methods is reviewed in terms of the philosophical and mathematical 
aspects of the techniques used to investigate the atomic arrangements in
 gaseous and amorphous substances. Both theory and experiment must be 
adapted to each other's limitations. This is accomplished often only 
after much time and study have been devoted to the problems. Some areas 
of application are favored by an overdeterminacy in the data, which 
helps to simplify the mathematical aspects of the analysis. Other areas 
have relatively few data compared to the number of unknown parameters. 
In such cases, special analytical procedures that use, for example, 
chemical and structural information are indispensible. Applications 
cover a broad range of problems and afford fundamental information to 
many fields of science.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Correlations of slope unity between the 
optical continuum luminosity and the Balmer line luminosities (Yee 1980;
 Shuder 1981) have been traditionally used to demonstrate that 
photoionization is the excitation mechanism of the emission lines in 
active galactic nuclei. This correlation can be expressed in terms of a 
constant and universal equivalent width of Hβ over five decades in 
optical-UV continuum luminosity. It is found that the equivalent width 
EWj^ of narrow-line objects (Seyfert 2's, NLRG) is not systematically 
different from that of broad-line dominated objects (QSO's BLRG, Seyfert
 1). Based on empirical evidence as well as on recent BLR models we 
argue that the global efficiency for reprocessing the number of ionizing
 photons into Hβ line photons is equal to or less than that given by 
recombination case B. Assuming a canonical cloud covering factor of Cf= 
0.1 of an isotropie UV source, for any reasonable value of the power-law
 index a (Lvcc v+a), we find a substantial deficit of ionizing photons 
in all AGN. For instance, an index of — 1.4 or as flat as — 0.6 leads to
 a deficit in ionizing photons of a factor of 25 and 4, respectively. A 
lower reprocessing efficiency as that characterizing the more recent BLR
 models brings the deficit in the range 8-15 (for α= —0.6). The solution
 envisaged to account for the apparent deficit and to explain how EWHβ 
can be aspect independent from Seyferts to radio galaxies and quasars is
 that the observed optical continuum originates from or near the 
line-emitting clouds (i.e., "hazy" nucleus) and is distinct from the 
primary ionizing radiation directly impinging on the clouds. Evidence 
for this is provided by the detection of continuum emission associated 
with the spatially resolved emission-line gas in radio galaxies and 
nearby Seyferts. The possible mechanisms envisaged to explain the 
spatial association of continuum emission and line emission are electron
 scattering, dust scattering, and in situ generation of continuum by 
high-velocity shocks, by thermal gas emission, or by inverse 
self-Compton scattering. The main observable consequences of this 
spatial association between the continuum and line emission are that (1)
 it can explain in a natural way the observed narrow range of EWHβ in 
AGN whether or not the primary ionizing source is anisotropic (2), it 
can result in similar temporal behavior of continuum and line emission 
(i.e., short time lags of the BLR lines) as a result of intermixed 
continuum and line reverberation, (3) and it explains why dust 
extinction of the nuclear continuum emission never exceeds that of the 
BLR lines (e.g., in Seyferts 1.8 and 1.9) since both emission processes 
being co-spatial are characterized by a similar path length to the 
observer.</li>

                <li>Abstract: This study demonstrates that the energy 
resolution of a newly developed 100 per cent pure polyvinyltoluene (PVT)
 plate allows its use as a base material for a plastic scintillator. The
 energy resolution, which is a key element for high-performance 
radiation detectors, was △E/E = 8.41 ± 0.07% (full width at half maximum
 (FWHM) for 976 ke V K-line conversion electrons from a ²⁰⁷Bi source. On
 the basis of results from ²⁰⁷Bi and ¹³⁷Cs sources, the observed energy 
resolution of the PVT plate, △E/E = 8.2/E 1/2 % (FWHM), was slightly 
better than that of a typical plastic scintillator (BC-408), △E/E = 
8.7/E 1/2 % (FWHM), with E in units of MeV. These results prompted us to
 search for other new base materials for plastic scintillators. In this 
study, we examined polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, a common 
source of domestic plastic waste. We demonstrated that a lump of 
heat-proof PET bottles is fluorescent; moreover, there is excellent 
compatibility of the fluorescence with the quantum efficiency of typical
 photomultiplier tubes. This inexpensive source of plastic appears 
suitable for radiation measurements and as a base material for plastic 
scintillators. Future studies on the radiation response of plastics 
should lead to the development of higher performance and more 
eco-friendly radiation detectors.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The absorption of light by materials 
proceeds through the formation of excitons, which are states in which an
 excited electron is bound to the valence hole it vacated. Understanding
 the structure and dynamics of excitons is important, for example, for 
developing technologies for light-emitting diodes or solar energy 
conversion. However, there has never been an experimental means to study
 the time-dependent structure of excitons directly. Here, we use 
causality-inverted inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) to image the 
charge-transfer exciton in the prototype insulator LiF, with resolutions
 Δt = 20.67 as (2.067 × 10⁻¹⁷ s) in time and Δx = 0.533 Å (5.33 × 10⁻¹¹ 
m) in space. Our results show that the exciton has a modulated internal 
structure and is coherently delocalized over two unit cells of the LiF 
crystal (≈8 Å). This structure changes only modestly during the course 
of its life, which establishes it unambiguously as a Frenkel exciton and
 thus amenable to a simplified theoretical description. Our results 
resolve an old controversy about excitons in the alkali halides and 
demonstrate the utility of IXS for imaging attosecond electron dynamics 
in condensed matter.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Supercomputer simulations predict the 
creation of an unexpectedly stable form of atomic matter when ordinary 
atoms are irradiated by very intense, high-frequency laser pulses. In 
the rising edge of a very intense pulse of ionizing radiation, the 
atom's wave function distorts adiabatically into a distribution with two
 well-separated peaks. As the intensity increases, the peak spacing 
increases so that the atomic electron spends more time far from the 
nucleus and the ionization rate decreases. This leads to the surprising 
and counter-intuitive result that the atom becomes more stable as the 
ionizing radiation gets stronger.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The recent technological revolution in the
 field of imaging techniques has provided pathologists and toxicologists
 with an expanding repertoire of analytical techniques for studying the 
interaction between the lung and the various exogenous materials to 
which it is exposed. Analytical problems requiring elemental sensitivity
 or specificity beyond the range of that offered by conventional 
scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis are 
particularly appropriate for the application of these newer techniques. 
Electron energy loss spectrometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, 
secondary ion mass spectrometry, and laser microprobe mass analysis each
 offer unique advantages in this regard, but also possess their own 
limitations and disadvantages. Diffraction techniques provide 
crystalline structural information available through no other means. 
Bulk chemical techniques provide useful cross-checks on the data 
obtained by microanalytical approaches. It is the purpose of this review
 to summarize the methodology of these techniques, acknowledge 
situations in which they have been used in addressing problems in 
pulmonary toxicology, and comment on the relative advantages and 
disadvantages of each approach. It is necessary for an investigator to 
weigh each of these factors when deciding which technique is best suited
 for any given analytical problem; often it is useful to employ a 
combination of two or more of the techniques discussed. It is 
anticipated that there will be increasing utilization of these 
technologies for problems in pulmonary toxicology in the decades to

                <li>Abstract: An understanding of proton radiobiology is
 critical for optimization of both proton radiotherapy and assessment of
 carcinogenesis risk from space radiation. Although the physical aspects
 of proton beam radiobiology is well understood, the biological aspects,
 particularly the complex biological end points, have been underexplored
 and underexploited. This review focuses on the biological responses 
observed to date, across various scales, molecular, cellular and 
especially tissue levels. Proton-induced perturbations of gene 
expression, along with signaling and functional alterations in cell 
cycle, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis are included. Particular 
emphasis is placed on differences noted in the literature between 
biological effects induced by protons and those induced by high-energy 
photons. An appreciation of the unique physical and biological 
characteristics of proton radiobiology should augment current strategies
 both to enhance therapeutic effectiveness and to quantify risk related 
to proton irradiation.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The effect of irradiating a number of 
sensitive explosive crystals (such as lead azide, silver azide, cadmium 
azide, nitrogen iodide and silver acetylide) with high-speed particles 
has been studied. They were subjected to irradiation by electrons, by 
neutrons, by fission products and by X-rays. All these substances were 
exploded by an intense electron stream, but experiment shows that this 
is a thermal effect and is due to a bulk heating of the crystal. 
Nitrogen iodide is exploded by fission products, but this substance is 
anomalous. With the other substances interesting changes within the 
crystal are observed and these affect the subsequent thermal 
decomposition but no explosion results. The experiments show that, in 
general, the activation of a small group of adjacent molecules is not 
enough to cause explosion. The effect of crystal size on explosion is 
also studied. It is shown that if the crystals are heated they do not 
explode unless their critical size exceeds a certain value, which 
depends upon the temperature and upon other factors. Under the 
conditions of these experiments the limiting size for a number of 
explosives is of the order of a few microns. The work supports the 
earlier conclusions (arrived at from friction and impact experiments) 
that the necessary 'hot-spot' size is large on a molecular scale (ca. 
10-5 to 10-3 cm in diameter); otherwise successful growth to detonation 
will not occur. Optical and electron microscopy provide some evidence 
that thermal decomposition takes place preferentially at dislocations 
inherent in the mosaic structure of the crystal.</li>

CHESS, will soon be completed at Cornell University. The facility will 
operate in a mode parasitic to high energy physics experiments on the 
new 8-billion-electron-volt electron-positron storage ring (CESR) at 
Cornell. Electron and positron beams have already been stored and the 
first photons have been extracted. When completed, the laboratory will 
be available to the scientific community nationally and will provide the

                <li>Abstract: One fundamental question about pulsars 
concerns the mechanism of their pulsed electromagnetic emission. 
Measuring the high-end region of a pulsar's spectrum would shed light on
 this question. By developing a new electronic trigger, we lowered the 
threshold of the Major Atmospheric γ-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) 
telescope to 25 giga--electron volts. In this configuration, we detected
 pulsed γ-rays from the Crab pulsar that were greater than 25 
giga--electron volts, revealing a relatively high cutoff energy in the 
phase-averaged spectrum. This indicates that the emission occurs far out
 in the magnetosphere, hence excluding the polar-cap scenario as a 
possible explanation of our measurement. The high cutoff energy also 
challenges the slot-gap scenario.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Hematopoietic system toxicity is a major 
limiting factor in the use of aggressive combined modality therapy in 
the treatment of malignant disease. In this review, the known drug-x-ray
 interactions using tissue culture systems are extended to the bone 
marrow compartment. Two hypotheses prevail for late bone marrow failure:
 (1) stromal damage to the vasculature with subsequent fibrosis and (2) 
irreversible stem cell depletion in the irradiated site. Clinical 
extensions of the experimental data for bone marrow kinetics in the 
animal model have not proven successful to date. The future strategies 
for therapy of malignancies in which both radiation and chemotherapy are
 employed may require dose modification or treatment planning to limit 
bone marrow toxicity.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) 
were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a 
laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200°C. X-ray 
diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly 
uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into "ropes," which 
consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with
 a lattice constant of 17 angstroms. The x-ray form factor is consistent
 with that of uniformly charged cylinders 13.8 ± 0.2 angstroms in 
diameter. The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of 
&lt;10$^{-4}$ ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT 
diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial 
fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter 
is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of 
the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge, where 
growth occurs. These factors strongly favor the metallic (10, 10) tube 
with C$_{5v}$ symmetry and an open edge stabilized by triple bonds.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Thin films of pGEM-3Zf(-) plasmid DNA were
 bombarded by 60 keV electrons with and without gold nanoparticles. DNA 
single- and double-strand breaks (SSBs and DSBs) were measured by 
agarose gel electrophoresis. From transmission electron micrographs, the
 gold nanoparticles were found to be closely linked to DNA scaffolds, 
probably as a result of electrostatic binding. The probabilities for 
formation of SSBs and DSBs from exposure of 1:1 and 2:1 gold 
nanoparticle:plasmid mixtures to fast electrons increase by a factor of 
about 2.5 compared to neat DNA samples. For monolayer DNA adsorbed on a 
thick gold substrate, the damage increases by an order of magnitude. The
 results suggest that the enhancement of radiosensitivity is due to the 
production of additional lowenergy secondary electrons caused by the 
increased absorption of ionizing radiation energy by the metal, in the 
form of gold nanoparticles or of a thick gold substrate. Since 
shortrange low-energy secondary electrons are produced in large amounts 
by any type of ionizing radiation, and since on average only one gold 
nanoparticle per DNA molecule is needed to increase damage considerably,
 targeting the DNA of cancer cells with gold nanoparticles may offer a 
novel approach that is generally applicable to radiotherapy treatments.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The classic atomic mix approximation for 
particle transport in a stochastic spatial medium is accurate when the 
material chunks in the medium are small compared to a mean free path. In
 this paper, we show that for charged particle transport in a stochastic
 medium, the atomic mix approximation is accurate when the chunk sizes 
are small compared to a transport mean free path. For charged particle 
transport, the transport mean free path is generally several orders of 
magnitude larger than the mean free path. Therefore, the result obtained
 in this paper greatly extends the known range of applicability of the 
atomic mix approximation. Numerical results are given that validate the 
asymptotic theory, and an application of the theory to a practical 
problem in radiation oncology is discussed.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The active galaxy Markarian 501 was 
discovered with air-Cerenkov telescopes at photon energies of 10 
tera-electron volts. Such high energies may indicate that the gamma rays
 from Markarian 501 are due to the acceleration of protons rather than 
electrons. Furthermore, the observed absence of gamma ray attenuation 
due to electron-positron pair production in collisions with cosmic 
infrared photons implies a limit of 2 to 4 nanowatts per square meter 
per steradian for the energy flux of an extragalactic infrared radiation
 background at a wavelength of 25 micrometers. This limit provides 
important clues about the epoch of galaxy formation.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The higher approximation terms of the 
interaction of an electron and a radiation field, which were obtained by
 the author in the previous paper, are applied here to investigate the 
probability of multiple scattering processes. It is shown that the 
probability of certain of these processes could be large. In particular 
it is shown that the probability of a photon dividing into a number of 
photons in the presence of an electron is appreciable under certain 
circumstances. This result shows that quantum electrodynamics does not 
disallow, as was believed earlier, the existence of photon showers in 
which the quanta are emitted simultaneously.</li>

                <li>Abstract: According to the two beam approximation of
 the dynamical theory of electron diffraction an electron propagating 
through a crystal is represented by a combination of two Bloch waves, 
one of which (the type 1 wave) tends to channel the electron between the
 planes of atoms while the other (the type 2 wave) locates the electron 
on average closer to the centres of the atoms. It has been suggested 
that as X-ray production might be expected to occur in regions close to 
the nuclei of the atoms, the type 2 wave should be more efficient at 
producing X-rays than the type 1 wave, and that this should result in a 
variation of X-ray production with orientation (Hirsch, Howie &amp; 
Whelan 1962). This paper describes an experimental investigation of this
 effect. A more complete theoretical treatment of the process is given 
followed by a description of the apparatus used in the experiments. It 
is shown that the results are in qualitative agreement with the simple 
theory, and can be explained quantitatively by extending the theory to 
take into consideration the effect of the other scattering processes 
which act upon the electrons which produce the X-rays.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Transient events observed since 1980 by 
the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer experiment on the Solar Maximum Mission 
satellite (SMM) have been identified with radiation emitted from 18 
different Soviet nuclear reactor--powered satellites. Most of these 
satellites are similar to Cosmos 954 and 1402 which reentered the 
atmosphere. Gamma radiation from these satellites was detected when they
 passed within about 400 to 500 kilometers of SMM. Positron annihilation
 line radiation (511 kiloelectron volts) and charged-particle events 
were detected when SMM encountered clouds of positrons and electrons 
emitted by these satellites and stored up to tens of minutes in the 
geomagnetic field. The rate of these events varied from about 1 in 5 
days to over 30 per day and was strongly dependent on the operating 
altitudes of the Cosmos satellites and density of the upper atmosphere.</li>

                <li>Abstract: When one measures the half-value layer 
(HVL) or the attenuation coefficient (μ) in a high-energy photon beam, 
it is necessary to use a narrow beam to eliminate the scattered photons 
produced in the attenuator. However, lateral electron equilibrium will 
be compromised if the beam is too small. If the HVL and μ are based on 
measurements of absorbed dose, the results will then depend on field 
size for a polyenergetic photon spectrum. The measured values also 
become sensitive to detector properties. This has been examined by 
experiments and Monte Carlo calculations. The field size should be 
sufficient for lateral electron equilibrium to prevent ambiguities in 
the resulting HVL or μ, which are of the order of 10% for 6-MV X rays.</li>

description of electron and photon accelerations; effects such as photon
 Landau damping arise naturally from such a treatment. Intense 
electromagnetic waves can act as a photon mirror to charged particles. 
The subsequent acceleration is equivalent to the photon pulse 
accelerating electrons. During the interaction or reflection process, 
the charged particle can emit bursts of radiation similar to the 
radiation emitted from the particles during wave breaking of plasma 
waves.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The scattering of leptons (e, μ, v) by 
hadrons at high momentum transfer has been the incisive probe of the 
internal dynamics of the proton. Point-like 'partons' are found inside 
the protons. These have the electromagnetic and weak properties expected
 of quarks, and are in dynamical equilibrium with a sea of virtual 
quark-antiquark pairs and gluons, the quanta of the strong force. 
Neutrino scattering has probed the weak coupling of the quarks, and 
their parity-violating handedness. Weak neutral currents (coupling with 
the Z0 boson) were discovered in neutrino scattering, and 
parity-violating γ-Z0 interference was observed in electron-deuteron 
scattering. The higher momentum transfers that will be available at the 
HERA electron-proton storage ring, now under construction, will greatly

                <li>Abstract: Compton profile data are used to 
investigate the ground state wavefunction of graphite. The results of 
two new γ-ray measurements are reported and compared with the results of
 earlier γ-ray and electron scattering measurements. A tight-binding 
calculation has been carried out and the results of earlier calculations
 based on a molecular model and a pseudo-potential wavefunction are 
considered. The analysis, in terms of the reciprocal form factor, shows 
that none of the calculations gives an adequate description of the data 
in the basal plane although the pseudo-potential calculation describes 
the anisotropy in the plane reasonably well. In the basal plane the 
zero-crossing theorem appears to be violated and this problem must be 
resolved before more accurate models can be derived. In the c-axis 
direction the molecular model and the tight binding calculation give 
better agreement with the experimental data than does the 
pseudopotential calculation.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Isolated neutron stars are seen in x-rays 
through their nonthermal and/or surface thermal emissions. X-ray 
Multimirror Mission-Newton observations of the Geminga pulsar show a 
43-electron volt spectrum from the whole neutron star surface, as well 
as a power-law component above 2 kiloelectron volts. In addition, we 
have detected a hot (170 electron volts) thermal emission from an 
~60-meter-radius spot on the pulsar's surface. Such a thermal emission, 
only visible at selected phase intervals, may be coming from polar hot 
spot(s), long thought to exist as a result of heating from 
magnetospheric accelerated particles. It may provide the missing link 
between the x-ray and gamma-ray emission of the pulsar.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A sonoluminescing bubble has been modeled 
as a thermally conducting, partially ionized, two-component plasma. The 
model shows that the measured picosecond pulse widths are due to 
electron conduction and the rapidly changing opacity of the plasma and 
that these mechanisms are also responsible for the absence of an 
"afterglow" subsequent to the sonoluminescence flash while the hot 
bubble expands and cools. The calculated spectra for sonoluminescing 
nitrogen and argon bubbles suggest that a sonoluminescing air bubble 
probably contains only argon, in agreement with a recent theoretical 
analysis.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The e6 corrections to the Moller formula 
for the scattering of electrons by electrons and the Bhabha formula for 
the scattering of positrons by electrons, arising from the interaction 
of the particles with virtual photons, are formulated using the 
Feynman-Dyson techniques. After removing ultra-violet divergences by 
mass and charge renormalization the cross-section still suffers from a 
logarithmic infra-red divergence. This is cancelled by adding on the 
cross-section for the production of a single real photon of low energy 
during the collision. The result is evaluated assuming that the maximum 
bremsstrahlung energy radiated is small compared with the rest energy of
 the electron, as viewed from the laboratory frame. Nonrelativistic and 
extreme relativistic approximations to the formulae are presented, 
together with the results of exact calculations for a laboratory energy 
of 20mc2.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The creation of inner-shell vacancies in 
atoms via the Compton effect is discussed. It is shown that the 
Klein-Nishina approximation leads to a simple vacancy distribution among
 the shells, independent of the photon energy. When atomic binding 
effects are taken into account an energy-dependent distribution can be 
calculated which tends to the Klein-Nishina results at higher photon 
energies. The inner-shell vacancies produce a potential energy on the 
ionized atom which is not necessarily small when compared with the 
recoil energy of the emitted electron. This additional effect 
contributes to a more complete description of mechanisms by which energy
 is transferred by the Compton interaction. Calculations are performed 
for aluminum exposed to photons with energies from 10 to 500 keV.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Electromagnetic phenomena occurring in the
 strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are currently of great interest
 in high-energy astrophysics. Observations of rotation rate changes and 
cyclotron lines in pulsars and γ-ray bursts indicate that surface 
magnetic fields of neutron stars often exceed 10$^{12}$ gauss. In fields
 this strong, where electrons behave much as if they were in bound 
atomic states, familiar processes undergo profound changes, and exotic 
processes become important. Strong magnetic fields affect the physics in
 several fundamental ways: Energies perpendicular to the field are 
quantized, transverse momentum is not conserved, and electron-positron 
spin is important. Neutron stars therefore provide a unique laboratory 
for the study of physics in extremely high fields that cannot be 
generated on Earth.</li>

                <li>Abstract: By moving a 152mEu2O3 source on the tips 
of a high-speed rotor, the 961 keV emission spectrum has been swept 
across the resonance line of a stationary Sm2O3 scatterer. The observed 
resonance/fluorescence intensity has been compared with a curve 
calculated by taking into account the Doppler effects due to electron 
capture and thermal motions but neglecting the effects of natural line 
widths. At negative rotor speeds, when the emission line scans the 
low-energy wing of the resonance line, the influence of the natural line
 width on the resonance/fluorescence intensity has been observed. At 
positive rotor speeds there is a good agreement with the theoretical 
calculations; this shows that with a stationary source the thermal 
broadening is dominant in restoring the resonance whereas the line wing 
overlap is negligible.</li>

                <li>Abstract: We report the detection of pulsed gamma 
rays from the Crab pulsar at energies above 100 giga—electron volts 
(GeV) with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System 
(VERITAS) array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The detection 
cannot be explained on the basis of current pulsar models. The photon 
spectrum of pulsed emission between 100 mega—electron volts and 400 GeV 
is described by a broken power law that is statistically preferred over a
 power law with an exponential cutoff. It is unlikely that the 
observation can be explained by invoking curvature radiation as the 
origin of the observed gamma rays above 100 GeV. Our findings require 
that these gamma rays be produced more than 10 stellar radii from the 
neutron star.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Gamma rays at energies of 0.3 to 8 
megaelectron volts (MeV) were detected on 15 April 1988 from four 
nuclear-powered satellites including Cosmos 1900 and Cosmos 1932 as they
 flew over a double Compton gamma-ray telescope. The observations 
occurred as the telescope, flown from a balloon at an altitude of 35 
kilometers from Alice Springs, Australia, searched for celestial 
gamma-ray sources. The four transient signals were detected in 30 hours 
of data. Their time profiles show maxima with duration of (21 $\pm $ 1) 
and (27 $\pm $ 1) seconds (half-width at half maximum) for the lower two
 satellites and (85 $\pm $ 5) and (113 $\pm $ 7) seconds for the 
remaining two. Their durations place the origin of the two shorter 
signals at orbital radii of 260$_{-60}^{+40}$ and 260 $\pm $ 60 km above
 the earth and the two longer at 800$_{-300}^{+100}$ and 
800$_{-300}^{+250}$ kilometers. Their luminosities for energies &gt;0.3 
MeV are then (6.1 $\pm $ 1.5) $\times $ 10$^{15}$, (3.9 $\pm $ 1.0) 
$\times $ 10$^{15}$, (1.10 $\pm $ 0.28) $\times $ 10$^{16}$, and (1.30 
$\pm $ 0.32) $\times $ 10$^{16}$ photons per second. The imaging of the 
strongest signal indicates a southeastern direction passing nearly 
overhead. The energy spectrum can be fit to an exponential with index 
2.4 $\pm $ 1.4. These transient events add to the already large 
backgrounds for celestial gamma ray sources.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Total absorption cross-sections of 
hydrogen, carbon, copper, silver, lead and uranium have been measured 
for photons of mean energy 94 MeV. The method was to measure the 
transmission through an absorber of photons from the Oxford synchrotron,
 using a biased liquid scintillation counter to select photons of energy
 near the peak energy of the machine. The experimental data for hydrogen
 have been used to deduce a value for the cross-section for pair 
production in the field of the electron of 4· 7 ± 0· 4 millibarn. The 
relative cross-sections for the heavier elements have been determined to
 better than ± 0· 2%, and confirm the most recent calculations of the 
correction to the Born approximation in the theory of pair production.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The disintegration of the radionuclides <sup>131</sup> I and <sup>125</sup>
 I and the subsequent charged-particle tracks left behind in water (as a
 model substance for a biological cell) are simulated by the Monte Carlo
 track structure simulation code PARTRAC, using new inelastic electron 
scattering cross sections for condensed water. Every photon and electron
 emitted was followed in detail, event by event, down to 10 eV. From the
 spatial information on the track structures, absorbed dose 
distributions per <sup>131</sup> I and <sup>125</sup> I decay were 
calculated in and around water spheres simulating micrometastases as 
well as in the tissue surrounding such metastases. These radionuclides 
were assumed to be distributed uniformly inside spheres of different 
diameters (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mm). The respective 
electron degradation spectra, the nearest-neighbor distance 
distributions between inelastic events, and the distance distributions 
for all activations for both iodine radionuclides were calculated. The 
absorbed fractions of the initial electron energies, absorbed doses and 
energy depositions, and single-event distributions, <tex-math>$F_{1}(\varepsilon)$</tex-math>,
 inside the six water spheres described above and in the surrounding 
tissue were also calculated. The absorbed doses per decay inside the six
 water spheres, i.e., the calculated S values (listed from 0.01 to 3.0 
mm), were <tex-math>$6.8\times 10^{-4}$</tex-math>, <tex-math>$7.2\times 10^{-5}$</tex-math>, 5.5× 10<sup>-6</sup>, <tex-math>$4.9\times 10^{-7}$</tex-math>, <tex-math>$3.1\times 10^{-8}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$1.8\times 10^{-9}\ {\rm Gy}\ {\rm Bq}^{-1}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$</tex-math> for <sup>131</sup> I, and <tex-math>$3.4\times 10^{-3}$</tex-math>, <tex-math>$1.7\times 10^{-4}$</tex-math>, <tex-math>$5.1\times 10^{-6}$</tex-math>, 2.0× 10<sup>-7</sup>, <tex-math>$5.6\times 10^{-9}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$2.2\times 10^{-10}\ {\rm Gy}\ {\rm Bq}^{-1}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$</tex-math> for <sup>125</sup> I. It is concluded that, in the treatment of thyroid cancer, the geometrical track structure properties of <sup>125</sup> I might be superior to those of <sup>131</sup>
 I in micrometastases with diameters less than 0.1 mm; however, in this 
medical context, many other factors also have to be considered.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The absorption spectra of fifty-two 
natural diamonds have been measured at 80 and 290 degrees K. Type I 
diamonds are shown to have two kinds of absorption centres which are not
 detected in type II diamonds. Differences in the infra-red absorption 
spectra between type IIa and type IIb diamonds are reported. The 
classification of diamonds is discussed. The absorption produced by 
irradiating diamonds with electrons, neutrons and γ -rays is described. 
The general nature of the changes produced by the different forms of 
radiation is the same, but significant differences in the breadths and 
wavelengths of the induced absorption lines have been observed. 
Electron-irradiated type IIa diamonds show absorption lines not observed
 in irradiated type I diamonds. There is a similarity between the sets 
of natural absorption lines in type I diamonds and those produced by 
irradiation. A model relating the induced absorption to interstitial 
carbon atoms, vacant atomic sites and regions of amorphous or graphitic 
carbon is proposed.</li>

                <li>Abstract: In the current paradigm of cold dark 
matter cosmology, large-scale structures are assembling through 
hierarchical clustering of matter. In this process, an important role is
 played by megaparsec (Mpc)--scale cosmic shock waves, arising in 
gravity-driven supersonic flows of intergalactic matter onto dark 
matter--dominated collapsing structures such as pancakes, filaments, and
 clusters of galaxies. Here, we report Very Large Array telescope 
observations of giant (∼2 Mpc by 1.6 Mpc), ring-shaped nonthermal 
radio-emitting structures, found at the outskirts of the rich cluster of
 galaxies Abell 3376. These structures may trace the elusive shock waves
 of cosmological large-scale matter flows, which are energetic enough to
 power them. These radio sources may also be the acceleration sites 
where magnetic shocks are possibly boosting cosmic-ray particles with 
energies of up to $10^{18}$ to $10^{19}$ electron volts.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Recent experiments have extended the 
knowledge of the flux and energy spectra of individual cosmic-ray 
components to much higher energies than had previously been accessible. 
Both electron and nuclear components show a behaviour at high energy 
which is unexpected, and which carries information regarding the sources
 and the propagation of particles between sources and observer. 
Electromagnetic interactions which are suffered by the electrons in 
interstellar space should steepen their spectrum, a steepening that 
would reveal the average lifetime a cosmic-ray particle spends in the 
galaxy. Measurements up to 1000 GeV show no such steepening. It was 
discovered that the composition of the nuclear species which is now 
measured up to 100 GeV/nucleon changes with energy. This change 
indicates traversal of less interstellar matter by the high energy 
particles than by those of lower energy. We discuss the experimental 
evidence and its implication.</li>

                <li>Abstract: We review high-energy observations of 
solar flares with emphasis on measurements by instruments on the Solar 
Maximum Mission satellite. Those observations show that, contrary to 
prior expectation, high-energy emission is a common property of solar 
flares. Direct interpretation of the measurements shows that both 
energetic ion and relativistic electron acceleration are ubiquitous 
flare phenomena and that those particles can be accelerated to high 
energies very rapidly. We present evidence that the high-energy emission
 from flares is anisotropic. We also review how studies of the nuclear 
line spectra have allowed derivation of characteristics of both the 
energetic ions and the target material. Altogether, these results 
clearly refute many of the old ideas about energetic flare particles and
 have stimulated new thinking about how particles are accelerated and 
transported during flares.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A calculation method of frequency 
distributions for the microdosimetric quantity j (number of effective 
primary events per track per target), f<sub>j</sub>, is presented. f<sub>j</sub> distributions are calculated for nanometer-size targets in water irradiated with <sup>60</sup> Co γ rays, using degradation spectra of total electrons in water, <tex-math>$\phi _{{\rm t}}(E)$</tex-math>. Further, fractional total electron differential fluences effective to produce j effective primary events, <tex-math>$\phi _{{\rm t}}(E,j)$</tex-math>,
 are calculated. It is found that the frequency for occurrence of no 
effective primary event tracks (tracks traversing the target without any
 effective primary event inside the target) is very large for 
nanometer-size targets, and that the δ-ray effect on the f<sub>j</sub> 
distribution becomes more significant with the decrease of the target 
size and especially j effective primary events (j ≥ 1) for very small

                <li>Abstract: In the structural characterization of thin
 specimens by projection (atomic column) imaging, the revolutionary 
development of aberration-corrected electron microscopy has already 
brought significant improvements not only in spatial resolution but also
 in improved image contrast. Some highlights from the symposium are 
summarized. Despite the purchasing and operating costs as well as the 
demands they place on operator skills, a staggering number of these new 
microscopes has already been installed worldwide. Serious challenges, 
therefore, arise including the need to attract customers from a wide 
range of disciplines where complex structure problems may require the 
development of new imaging modes. The ability to image at large 
scattering angles may be useful in mitigating some of the many as-yet 
uncorrected delocalization mechanisms that then arise and are 
systematically identified here. Larger specimen volumes made possible by
 chromatic aberration correction will benefit the development of more 
relevant in situ observations, particularly in materials science and 
catalysis. With additional incorporation of phase shifting electrodes or
 other devices, these chromatic aberration correctors could also be 
important for efficient phase contrast imaging in easily damaged 
biological structures. For many of these formidable problems, earlier 
experience of the optical microscopy community may teach some lessons.</li>

                <li>Abstract: An experiment has been set up at the 
Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Facility to make absolute absorption 
cross section measurements over a wide range of photon energies. New 
data are reported for helium, neon, argon and krypton over the range 
340-40 Å which are believed to be reliable to ± 5%. A critical 
evaluation of published cross section data has been carried out to 
produce best value data from the ionization thresholds throughout the 
vacuum ultraviolet and X-ray region. Agreement with theoretical 
calculations on helium is demonstrated to be within ± 2-3% from 
threshold down to the double ionization threshold at 79 eV. Comparison 
with recent calculations of photoionization cross sections has shown 
that the effect of electron correlations is significant for the heavier 
inert gases. Contrary to previous claims, the position of the M shell 
maximum in krypton is located at 184 ± 10 eV in good agreement with 
r.p.a.e. calculations. Oscillator strength sum rules have been examined 
and their moments calculated. Discrepancies developing towards the 
heavier inert gases suggests a decrease in polarizabilities and other 
atomic factors from those predicted by Hartree-Fock calculations.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Calculations of mass energy-transfer and 
mass energy-absorption coefficients for photon energies from 1 keV to 
100 MeV have been developed, based on a re-examination of the processes 
involved after the initial photon interaction. The prob-abilities for 
the initial interaction are from the current photon interaction 
cross-section database at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. The calculations then take into account (1) electron binding
 effects on the Compton-scattered photon distribution; (2) the complete 
cascade of fluorescence emission after ionization events in any atomic 
subshell, including those associated with incoherent scattering and 
triplet production; and (3) the radiative energy losses of the secondary
 electrons and positrons slowing down in the medium, including the 
emission of bremsstrahlung, characteristic X rays from impact 
ionization, and positron in-flight as well as at-rest annihilation 
quanta. Consideration of the processes in (3) goes beyond the 
continuous-slowing-down approximation and includes the effects of 
energy-loss straggling. Results for the mass energy-absorption 
coefficient are compared with those from recent tabulations.</li>

C, N, O, and Ar, developed at the National Bureau of Standards by the 
X-Ray and Ionizing Radiation Data Center from the latest theoretical and

 0.1 keV to 20 MeV, including the cesium-137 and cobalt-60 energies 
explicitly. Cross sections are listed, for the above elements, for the 
principal photon-atom interactions: coherent and incoherent scattering, 
atomic photoeffect, and positron-electron pair and triplet production; 
the energy-absorption cross sections for these interactions are also 
listed. From this cross-section data base, mass energy-absorption 
coefficients <tex-math>$\mu _{{\rm en}}/\rho $</tex-math>, taking into 
account bremsstrahlung losses and positron annihilation in flight, 
Compton-scattered and fluorescence photons, and mass-attenuation 
coefficients μ/ρ, are tabulated for the above elements and for the 
mixtures: air, water, polystyrene, methyl methacrylate (Lucite, Perspex,
 Plexiglass, etc.), polyethylene, bakelite, and amber over the range 
from 0.1 keV to 20 MeV. For application to cavity ionization detector 
metrology the ratio <tex-math>$\mu _{{\rm en}}/\rho $</tex-math> in air 
to that in carbon and to that in the above six remaining mixtures is 
tabulated over the same energy range. The air and carbon <tex-math>$\mu _{{\rm en}}/\rho $</tex-math> values and air/carbon ratios are compared with those in ICRU Report 17 and other earlier compilations.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction 
by perfect crystals applied to Bragg-case reflexion of a spatially 
narrow beam of coherent spherical waves at a crystal surface predicts 
that the spatial intensity distribution of the reflected beam contains 
oscillations due to Pendellosung interference, but with amplitudes very 
rapidly decaying in comparison with those occurring in the transmission 
(Laue) case. Computed intensity profiles for the Bragg case show that 
when unpolarized X-radiation is used superimposition of fringe patterns 
due to the perpendicular and parallel polarization modes will destroy 
fringe visibility unless the Bragg angle, θ B, is quite small or 2θ B is
 close to 90 degrees; doubt is thus cast on Uragami's (1969) claim to 
have observed fringes in an experiment with 2θ B = 43 degrees. A new 
experiment is described using the diamond 113 reflexion and Cu Kα 1 
radiation for which 2θ B is 91.5⚬. Fringes up to the fifth order were 
recognizable; measurements were made on the first four fringes and from 
these measurements an absolute value of the room temperature atomic 
scattering factor, f, of carbon in the diamond 113 reflexion was 
determined as f=1.63± 0.03 electron units.</li>

                <li>Abstract: Radiation damage is the major impediment 
for obtaining structural information from biological samples by using 
ionizing radiation such as x-rays or electrons. The knowledge of 
underlying processes especially at cryogenic temperatures is still 
fragmentary, and a consistent mechanism has not been found yet. By using
 a combination of single-crystal x-ray diffraction, small-angle 
scattering, and qualitative and quantitative radiolysis experiments, we 
show that hydrogen gas, formed inside the sample during irradiation, 
rather than intramolecular bond cleavage between non-hydrogen atoms, is 
mainly responsible for the loss of high-resolution information and 
contrast in diffraction experiments and microscopy. The experiments that
 are presented in this paper cover a temperature range between 5 and 160
 K and reveal that the commonly used temperature in x-ray 
crystallography of 100 K is not optimal in terms of minimizing radiation
 damage and thereby increasing the structural information obtainable in a
 single experiment. At 50 K, specific radiation damage to disulfide 
bridges is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to 100 K, and samples can 
tolerate a factor of 2.6 and 3.9 higher dose, as judged by the increase 
of <tex-math>$R_{free} $</tex-math> values of elastase and cubic insulin crystals, respectively.</li>

development of a nanotechnology-based multi-pixel beam array small 
animal microirradiation system. The microirradiation system uses carbon 
nanotube field emission technology to generate arrays of individually 
controllable X-ray pixel beams that electronically form irregular 
irradiation fields having intensity and temporal modulation without any 
mechanical motion. The microirradiation system, once developed, will be 
incorporated with the micro-CT system already developed that is based on
 the same nanotechnology to form an integrated image-guided and 
intensity-modulated microirradiation system for hightemporal-resolution 
small animal research. Prospective microirradiation designs were 
evaluated based on dosimetry calculated using EGSnrc-based Monte Carlo 
simulations. Design aspects studied included X-ray anode design, 
collimator design, and dosimetric considerations such as beam energy, 
dose rate, inhomogeneity correction, and the microirradiation treatment 
planning strategies. The dosimetric properties of beam energies between 
80-400 kVp with varying filtration were studied, producing a pixel beam 
dose rate per current of 0.35-13 Gy per min per mA at the 
microirradiation isocenter. Using opposing multi-pixel-beam array pairs 
reduces the dose inhomogeneity between adjacent pixel beams to 
negligible levels near the isocenter and 20% near the mouse Surface.</li>

                <li>Abstract: A selection of recent scientific findings 
from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory is presented. In gamma-ray burst 
astrophysics, notable is the dramatic confirmation that bursts are 
isotropic but spatially inhomogeneous in their distribution. They 
exhibit temporal effects consistent with a time dilation as expected for
 a cosmologically distributed population; however alternate explanations
 cannot be ruled out. Also notable is the detection of delayed, 
nonthermal high-energy (MeV and GeV) gamma-ray emission possibly 
indicating that particle acceleration lasts long after the prompt 
emission. In active galactic nuclei (AGN) research, a new class of 
objects, the gamma-ray blazars, has been identified and a possible 
additional subclass of "MeV bump" quasars has emerged as well. Both of 
these AGN subclasses emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity above ~
 1 MeV. Gamma-ray bright Seyfert galaxies exhibit spectra which cut off 
at ~ 100 keV indicative of thermal emission from plasma near the central
 engine, which has significant implications for both AGN emission models
 and the origin of the diffuse X-ray background. The detection of 
nuclear emission lines from ⁵⁷Co in SN 1987A, ⁴⁴Ti in Cas A, and the 
mapping of emission from ²⁶A1 along the galactic plane all have 
important implications for our understanding of nucleosynthesis and 
supernova dynamics. Monitoring of the Galactic Center electron-positron 
annihilation source has failed to reveal any dramatic variability 
episodes as have been reported in the past by some previous experiments,
 and a model consisting of a bulge component and a disk component has 
begun to emerge. A dramatic increase in the number of known radio 
pulsars with gamma-ray emission, from 2 to 7, and gamma-ray light curves
 of unprecedented detail have provided tremendous insight into pulsar 
research. Nearly uninterrupted daily monitoring of a number of 
accretion-driven X-ray pulsars has provided an unprecedented view of 
their torque histories. A transition from spin-up to a spin-down state 
of GX 1+4 has recently been documented. Orbital solutions for the binary
 systems OAO 1657-415 and A 0535+26 have been derived, and for A 0535+26
 a cyclotron absorption feature, suggestive of magnetic field strengths 
of &gt; 10¹³ Gauss has been detected. The study of X-ray novae, which 
thrived in the late 1970' s has experienced a rejuvenation of 
significant proportions as a result of the Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory's all-sky monitoring capabilities and programmatic 
flexibility.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The application of in vivo measurement 
techniques, derived from nuclear and atomic physics, to problems 
encountered in occupational medicine is discussed. The main techniques, 
neutron activation and X-ray fluorescence, are described, and their use 
for in vivo measurements of cadmium and lead is explored in some detail.
 The extension of these and other, related, techniques to the possible 
measurement of other elements of importance in occupational medicine is 
considered. The use of in vivo measurements as a tool for research into 
the toxicological effects of cadmium, associated with occupational 
exposure is taken as an example of the way in which in vivo elemental 
analysis can contribute to research in occupational medicine.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The exposure of subnuclear compartments of
 cells to ionizing radiation is currently not trivial. We describe here a
 collimator for micrometer-wide stripe irradiation designed to work with
 conventional high-voltage X-ray tubes and cells cultured on standard 
glass cover slips. The microcollimator was fabricated by high-precision 
silicon micromachining and consists of X-ray absorbing chips with 
grooves of highly controlled depths, between 0.5-10 micrometers, along 
their surfaces. These grooves form Xray collimating slits when the chips
 are stacked against each other. The use of this device for radiation 
biology was examined by irradiating human cells with X rays having 
energies between 20-30 keV. After irradiation, p53 binding protein 1 
(53BP1), a nuclear protein that is recruited at sites of DNA 
double-strand breaks, clustered in lines corresponding to the irradiated
 Stripes.</li>

                <li>Abstract: The underlying source of power in active 
galaxies and quasars is still debated. X-ray observations of these 
objects may relate more directly with this power source than 
observations in other wavebands. Theories of active galactic nuclei are 
reviewed, together with X-ray production mechanisms, both thermal and 
non-thermal. Constraints imposed on these theories by present and future
 observations are discussed and interpreted in terms of some models for 
specific objects.</li>
