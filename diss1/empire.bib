century to the First World War. It is shown that the divergence in real incomes observed in the mid-nineteenth century was produced between 1500 and 1750 as incomes fell in most European cities but were maintained (not increased) in the economic leaders.}

What are the implications for people's lives and  their environment? Building on an award-winning article, in this  exciting book Roger Fouquet investigates the impacts of technological  innovations and economic development over the last seven hundred years  on our ability to provide heat, power, transport and light. Using a  unique data set, collected over a decade, the analysis identifies the  forces driving revolutions in energy services. It highlights the  tendency of markets to produce ever-cheaper energy services, which in  turn incite greater energy consumption. It also examines how these  revolutions affect people's well-being and the environment. The  framework, analysis and insights in this book offer an original  perspective on future energy markets, transitions to low-carbon  economies and strategies for addressing climate change.}

	shorttitle = {The Great Divergence},
	publisher = {Princeton University Press},
	author = {Kenneth Pomeranz},
	month = dec,
	year = {2001},
	annote = {The Great Divergence brings new insight to one of the classic  questions of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in  Northwest Europe, despite surprising similarities between advanced areas  of Europe and East Asia? As Ken Pomeranz shows, as recently as 1750,  parallels between these two parts of the world were very high in life  expectancy, consumption, product and factor markets, and the strategies  of households. Perhaps most surprisingly, Pomeranz demonstrates that the  Chinese and Japanese cores were no worse off ecologically than Western  Europe. Core areas throughout the eighteenth-century Old World faced  comparable local shortages of land-intensive products, shortages that  were only partly resolved by trade.
Pomeranz argues that  Europe's nineteenth-century divergence from the Old World owes much to  the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for timber. This made  Europe's failure to use its land intensively much less of a problem,  while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries. Another crucial  difference that he notes has to do with trade. Fortuitous global  conjunctures made the Americas a greater source of needed primary  products for Europe than any Asian periphery. This allowed Northwest  Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize further in  manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased imports  rather than maximizing yields. Together, coal and the New World allowed  Europe to grow along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths.
Meanwhile,  Asia hit a cul-de-sac. Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed after  1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth prevented  these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the  cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. As a result, growth in the core of East  Asia's economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was forced  along labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have  been forced down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks  from underground and overseas.}

	year = {1997},
	annote = {This new work by R. Bin Wong is much more than just another important historical monograph on China. It is more even than just another impressive display of its author's scholarly breadth and commitment to conducting theoretically informed comparative historical studies. It is nothing less than a bold and inspiring manifesto which spells out plainly for us why conducting broad comparisons with different historical arcs traced in other parts of the world can be so essential to our writing better histories of China. It also illustrates for us exactly how such a complex and challenging agenda of comparative studies might be framed. The book is written so as to be engaging and accessible to several audiences including historians of China and other Asianists, historians of Europe and North America, and students of social theory generally. Most readers, accustomed perhaps to consuming rather specialized diets of works in these different subdisciplines, may be prone to find at least some portions of Wong's book not quite digestible. But it can still be recommended for chewing by all. Vivienne Shue, Cornell University}
