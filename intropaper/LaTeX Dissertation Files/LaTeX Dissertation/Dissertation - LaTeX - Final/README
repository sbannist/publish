This directory contains a minor update of the University of Utah
sample thesis to illustrate use with LaTeX 2e, which has been the
standard version of LaTeX since the appearance of the second edition
of the LaTeX Users Guide and Reference Manual in 1994.

The Makefile has been updated to include GNU standard targets [See the
GNU Makefile standards in emacs help node "(Standards) Standard
Targets".]  

The Makefile also includes targets for creating PostScript and PDF
versions of the thesis.

To typeset this document, ensure that uuthesis2e.cls is in your
TEXINPUTS search path (a copy is available in ../latex2e).  Then
use the GNU standard incantation:

	./configure && make all check install

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WELCOME.

The files in this directory contain most everything you will need to
format a thesis in LaTeX following the University of Utah thesis
editor's guidelines.  At first glance, especially if you are
unfamiliar with LaTeX, this may seem rather complicated.  It really is
not very hard.  Much of the contents of this directory are examples of
doing special or complicated technical formatting.  Most likely you
will only use some of the options available and may ignore most of the
files here.

NOTE: This is a TEMPLATE for a dissertation which uses the uuthesis
style in LaTeX.  It is set up for you to copy and then include the
body of your thesis.  Although the thesis this sample was derived from
went through the thesis office with few problems, formats do change over
time and your thesis will probably still require some hand editing.

The main file is the file thesis.tex.  It will pull in all the "stuff"
you will need to construct the thesis.  LaTeXing this file 

	latex2e thesis

will build an up-to-date thesis.dvi file.  I have included a makefile
which can do some of the work automatically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The MAKEFILE has the following commands setup.

make thesis - runs make thesis.dvi, make spell and make dw.

make thesis.dvi - the main build command.  The file thesis.tex is 
processed through latex2e, bibtex and sed to produce a "correct" final 
copy.  This takes 3 passes through latex2e to complete.  The output is 
thesis.dvi.  This maybe viewed by 

          xdvi thesis.dvi &

Note: make thesis.dvi can create many auxilary files.  Explanations of 
some are provided below.

make spell - checks for spelling errors.  Words that do not 
appear in the dictionary or the file thesis.spell-ok will be 
placed in a file thesis.spell.   Once the words in thesis.spell are 
verified (or the source corrected) they should be placed in 
thesis.spell-ok.  The words in  thesis.spell-ok should be sorted.   
Emacs can do the sort: select the region and do M-x sort-lines.  

make dw - find double words.  The word and it's location is 
placed in a file thesis.dw. 

Normally, one will just type "latex2e thesis" to update the thesis.dvi 
file. After adding a citation to the thesis and the citation data to
the bib database thesis.bib, you need to "latex2e thesis" and then
"bibtex thesis".  The citations will appear after two more "latex2e
thesis"'s. 

The essential files for the "make thesis" to work:

Makefile
README
abstract.tex
acknowledge.tex
appendix.tex
auxdefs.sty
box.tex
chap1.tex
chap2.tex
chap3.tex
diagram.sty
fig1.tex
fig2.tex
fig3.tex
notation.tex
rhs.tex
thesis.bib
thesis.sty
thesis.tex
uumods.sty

The full compliment of files after a make thesis will look like:

Makefile
README
abstract.tex
acknowledge.tex
appendix.aux
appendix.tex
auxdefs.sty
box.tex
chap1.aux
chap1.tex
chap2.aux
chap2.tex
chap3.aux
chap3.tex
diag_examples.tex
diag_manual.tex
diagram-3.1.tar
diagram.sty
fig1.tex
fig2.tex
fig3.tex
lams1.mf
lams2.mf
lams3.mf
lams4.mf
lams5.mf
lamsarrow.sty
notation.tex
rhs.tex
rhs_mod.tex
tgrind.sty
thesis.aux
thesis.bbl
thesis.bib
thesis.blg
thesis.dvi
thesis.dw
thesis.lof
thesis.log
thesis.lot
thesis.spell-okay
thesis.sty
thesis.tex
thesis.toc
thesis.toc.old

This example is still under construction!!!

Good Luck,
